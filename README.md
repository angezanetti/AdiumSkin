Adium Skin
=================

This skin is another variant for the minimal mod of Adium. I designed it for IRC mostly, it's the minimal mod Balck & Gery but with a nice highlight for IRC mentions :)


Usage
-----
Just drag & drop this css file in the /Applications/Adium.app/Contents/Resources/Message Styles/minimal_mod.AdiumMessageStyle/Contents/Resources/Variants folder.
Restart and this should works
